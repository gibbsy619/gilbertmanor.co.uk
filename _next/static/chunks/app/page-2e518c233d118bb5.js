Player Detection: Utilizes OpenPose, a deep learning model that detects player positions and movements.  \n      - Tackle Detection: Identifies when a tackle occurs by analyzing the relative movement and positioning of players.  \n      - Tackle Risk Classification: Determines if a tackle is low-risk or high-risk based on player positioning.  \n\n      **Methodology & Development**  \n      - Video footage from professional rugby matches was used to train and test the models.  \n      - Player tracking was refined with custom algorithms, ensuring unique player IDs were maintained across frames.  \n\n      **Key Technologies Used**  \n      - OpenPose for player detection and pose estimation  \n      - Deep learning-based object detection models (YOLO, RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN)  \n      - Python & TensorFlow for model training and evaluation  \n\n      **Results & Performance**  \n      - Overall System Accuracy: 71.56%  \n      - High-risk tackle detection accuracy: 50%  \n      - Non-dangerous tackle detection accuracy: 78%  \n      - Outperformed previous rule-based systems, offering improved decision-making capabilities.  \n\n      **Challenges & Limitations**  \n      - Ball Detection Issues: Existing models struggled to accurately detect the ball in complex scenarios.  \n      - Camera Angle Variability: System performance can fluctuate based on video angles and resolutions.  \n      - Real-time Integration: Further development is needed to reduce latency, allowing for potential use by referees and medical teams during live matches.  \n\n      **Potential Applications & Future Work**  \n      - Referee Assistance: Automated tackle risk classification could aid referees in making quicker, more accurate decisions.  \n      - Player Safety Monitoring: Clubs and medical staff could use it to track dangerous tackles throughout a season.  \n      - Expansion to Other Sports: The model could be adapted to detect high-risk plays in American football, hockey, and MMA.  \n\n      **Conclusion**  \n      This project demonstrates that AI and computer vision can be used to automate and improve rugby tackle assessments, reducing reliance on human judgment and enhancing player safety.  \n\n      **Want to learn more?** \n      If you're interested in AI applications in sports, feel free to reach out or check out my full dissertation!\n      "},{name:"NRL Analytics Platform",link:"#",image:"\uD83C\uDFC9",githubLink:"https://github.com/gibbsy619/NRL-analytics-platform",detailedInfo:"NRL Analytics Platform: Comprehensive Analysis of Rugby League Performance\n      **Introduction**\n      The NRL (National Rugby League) Analytics Platform provides an in-depth analysis of rugby league performance metrics, helping to visualize and understand match data.\n\n      **System Overview**\n      Data Collection: SQL queries extract match statistics, including scores, player performance, and team metrics.\n      Data Processing: Aggregates match data to provide season-long performance insights.\n      Data Visualization: Uses React and JavaScript to create interactive dashboards.\n      **Methodology & Development**\n      Database Management: SQL ensures efficient data retrieval.\n      Front-end Development: JavaScript & React for user interaction.\n      Back-end Development: Node.js & Express for API handling.\n      **Challenges & Limitations**\n      Data Quality: Ensuring accurate historical data.\n      Scalability: Handling large data volumes.\n      Real-time Integration: Potential future enhancement.\n      **Potential Applications**\n      Coaching Assistance: Detailed insights for training.\n      Fan Engagement: Deeper understanding of team performance.\n      **Conclusion**\n      The NRL Analytics Platform demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance rugby league analysis, offering valuable insights into match performance and trends.\n      "},{name:"Golf Strava-like Application",link:"#",image:"⛳️",githubLink:"https://github.com/gibbsy619/Golf-Strava",detailedInfo:"\n      **Golf Strava Application: Simplified Golf Scorekeeping and GPS Tracking**  \n\n      **Introduction**  \n      The Golf Strava Application is designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for golfers to keep score and track their rounds using GPS, similar to how Strava tracks fitness activities.  \n\n      **System Overview**  \n      -
